# Ambulance Detection Project

This project detects ambulances in videos using YOLO (You Only Look Once) and detects sirens in audio using a TensorFlow Lite model. When both an ambulance and a siren are detected, the system communicates with an Arduino to turn all traffic lights red.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- YOLO model

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ambulance-detection.git

2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
